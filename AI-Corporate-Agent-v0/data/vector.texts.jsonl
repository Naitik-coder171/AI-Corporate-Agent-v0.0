DIRECTORS’ POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the company’s business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the company.
Shareholders’ reserve power
(1)	The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, 	or refrain from taking, specified action.
(2)	No such special resolution invalidates anything which the 	directors have done before the passing of the resolution.
Directors may delegate
(1) 	Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers 	which are conferred on them under the articles—
to such person or committee,
by such means (including by power of attorney), 
to such an extent,
in relation to such matters or territories, and
on such terms and conditions,
	as they think fit.
(2)	If the directors so specify, any such delegation may authorise 	further delegation of the directors’ powers by any person to whom they 	are delegated.
(3) 	The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter 	its terms and conditions.
Committees
(3) 	The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter 	its terms and conditions.
Committees

(2)	The directors may make rules of procedure for all or any 	committees, 	which prevail over rules derived from the articles if they 	are not consistent with them.
DECISION-MAKING BY DIRECTORS
Directors  to take decisions collectively
(1) 	The general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision 	of the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a 	decision taken in accordance with article 8.
(2) If—
the company only has one director, and
no provision of the articles requires it to have more than one director,
the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of the articles relating to directors’ decision-making.
Unanimous  decisions
Unanimous  decisions
(1)	A decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter.
(2) 	Such a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, copies of which have been signed by each eligible director or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing.
(3) 	References in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors’ meeting.

Calling a directors’ meeting
(1) 	Any director may call a directors’ meeting by giving notice of the meeting to the directors or by authorising the company secretary (if any) to give such notice.

its proposed date and time,
where it is to take place, and
(2) 	Notice of any directors’ meeting must indicate
its proposed date and time,
where it is to take place, and
if it is anticipated that directors participating in the meeting will not be in the same place, how it is proposed that they should communicate with each other during the meeting.
(3)	Notice of a directors’ meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing.
(4)	Notice of a directors’ meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the company not more than 7 days after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.
Participation in directors’ meetings
(1) 	Subject  to  the  articles,  directors  participate  in  a  directors’  meeting,  	or  part  of  a directors’ meeting, when—

# Candidate Task Sheet: Build an ADGM-Compliant Corporate Agent with Document Intelligence 

## 1. Task Overview 

As part of the evaluation process, you are required to build an intelligent AI-powered legal assistant called the Corporate Agent . This agent will assist in reviewing, validat-ing, and helping users prepare documentation for business incorporation and compliance within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) jurisdiction. 

Key Capabilities: The agent must accept uploaded legal documents (in ‘.docx‘ format), verify completeness of submissions based on ADGM rules, highlight red flags, insert contextual comments, and generate a reviewed, downloadable version of the file. It should also inform users if required documents are missing based on a pre-defined checklist. You are also provided with official ADGM links and a reference document. You must apply RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure your system aligns with real-world ADGM laws, regulations, and processes.

## 2. Functional Objectives 

Your Corporate Agent should be able to: 1. Accept ‘.docx‘ documents uploaded by the user. 2. Parse the uploaded documents and identify document types. 3. Check if all mandatory documents are present for specific legal processes (e.g., company incorporation). 4. Detect legal red flags and inconsistencies within each document. 5. Insert contextual comments in the ‘.docx‘ file for flagged content. 6. Provide legally compliant clause suggestions (optional). 7. Output a downloadable marked-up ‘.docx‘ file. 8. Generate a structured JSON/Python report summarizing the findings. 13. New Feature: Document Checklist Verification 

Your agent must also: 

• Automatically recognize which legal process the user is attempting (e.g., incorpo-ration, licensing, etc.). 

• Compare uploaded documents against the required ADGM checklist. 

• Notify the user if any mandatory document is missing.
• Compare uploaded documents against the required ADGM checklist. 

• Notify the user if any mandatory document is missing. 

• Example: For Company Incorporation, if only 4 of the 5 required documents are uploaded, the agent should respond: “It appears that you’re trying to incorporate a company in ADGM. Based on our reference list, you have uploaded 4 out of 5 required documents. The missing document appears to be: ‘Register of Members and Direc-tors’.” 

## 4. Technical Requirements

• Inputs: ‘.docx‘ documents 

• Outputs: 

– Reviewed ‘.docx‘ file with highlights/comments
